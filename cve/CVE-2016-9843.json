An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, via a specially crafted     document, to cause a denial of service condition.\n    (CVE-2016-9840)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic error exists in     zlib within file inffast.c. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, via a specially crafted     document, to cause a denial of service condition.\n    (CVE-2016-9841)\n\n  - A flaw exists in zlib in the z_streamp() function     within file inflate.c that is related to left shifts of     negative numbers. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, via a specially crafted     document, to cause a denial of service condition.\n    (CVE-2016-9842)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds pointer flaw exists in the crc32_big()     function within file crc32.c when handling big-endian     pointer calculations. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, via a specially crafted     document, to cause a denial of service condition.\n    (CVE-2016-9843)\n\n  - A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in     the web-based user interface due to improper validation     of user-supplied input before returning it to users. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a     specially crafted request, to execute arbitrary script     code in a user's browser session. (CVE-2017-1203)\n\n  - An XML external entity (XXE) injection flaw exists when     parsing XML data due to an incorrectly configured XML     parser accepting XML external entities from untrusted     sources. An authenticated, remote attacker can exploit     this, via specially crafted XML data, to disclose     sensitive information or cause a denial of service     condition.
