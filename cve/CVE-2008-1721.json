Third-party library update for ntp.\n   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's   time with a referenced time source.\n   ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the   following security issue. Note that the same security issue is   present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of   this advisory.\n   A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4   authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key   cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could   use this flaw to send a specially crafted request packet that could   crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the   privileges of the 'ntp' user.\n   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.\n   The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant   for ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0.\n d. Service Console update for ntp\n\n  Service Console package ntp updated to version ntp-4.2.2pl-9el5_3.2    The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's   time with a referenced time source.\n   The Service Console present in ESX is affected by the following   security issues.\n   A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4   authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key   cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could   use this flaw to send a specially crafted request packet that could   crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the   privileges of the 'ntp' user.\n   NTP authentication is not enabled by default on the Service Console.\n   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.\n   A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A   malicious, remote server could send a specially crafted reply to an   ntpq request that could crash ntpq or, potentially, execute   arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ntpq   command.\n   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-0159 to this issue.\n  e. Updated Service Console package kernel\n\n  Updated Service Console package kernel addresses the security   issues listed below.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2008-3528, CVE-2008-5700, CVE-2009-0028,   CVE-2009-0269, CVE-2009-0322, CVE-2009-0675, CVE-2009-0676,   CVE-2009-0778 to the security issues fixed in kernel   2.6.18-128.1.6.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2008-4307, CVE-2009-0834, CVE-2009-1337,   CVE-2009-0787, CVE-2009-1336 to the security issues fixed in   kernel 2.6.18-128.1.10.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2009-1439, CVE-2009-1633, CVE-2009-1072,   CVE-2009-1630, CVE-2009-1192 to the security issues fixed in   kernel 2.6.18-128.1.14.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2007-5966, CVE-2009-1385, CVE-2009-1388,   CVE-2009-1389, CVE-2009-1895, CVE-2009-2406, CVE-2009-2407 to the   security issues fixed in kernel 2.6.18-128.4.1.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2009-2692, CVE-2009-2698 to the   security issues fixed in kernel 2.6.18-128.7.1.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2009-0745, CVE-2009-0746, CVE-2009-0747,   CVE-2009-0748, CVE-2009-2847, CVE-2009-2848 to the security issues   fixed in kernel 2.6.18-164.\n\n f. Updated Service Console package python\n\n  Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.\n\n  When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization   flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that   led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values   meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than   expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the   Python interpreter's privileges.\n\n  Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python   Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string   object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause   a denial of service.\n\n  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop   module. If a Python application used the imageop module to   process untrusted images, it could cause the application to   disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute   arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.\n\n  Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the   Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use   these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).\n\n  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python   modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of   service.\n\n  An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was   found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application   requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression   stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,   execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.\n\n  A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python   locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly   NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data   stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721   CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143   CVE-2008-3144 CVE-2008-4864 CVE-2008-5031 to these issues.\n\n g. Updated Service Console package bind\n\n  Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5\n\n  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the   Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server   (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when   interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server   is operating correctly.\n\n  A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message   packets containing the 'ANY' record type. A remote attacker could   use this flaw to send a specially crafted dynamic update packet   that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.\n\n h. Updated Service Console package libxml2\n\n  Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.\n\n  libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A   Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also   which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML   files.\n\n  A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the   root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker   could provide a specially crafted XML file, which once opened by a   local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.\n\n  Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses   the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker   could provide a specially crafted XML file, which once opened by a   local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these   issues.\n\n i. Updated Service Console package curl\n\n  Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5_3.5\n\n  A cURL is affected by the previously published 'null prefix attack',   caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509   certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted   certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker   could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and   potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-2417 to this issue\n\n j. Updated Service Console package gnutls\n\n  Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5_3.5\n\n  A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in   certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get   a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority   trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the   certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially   confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-2730 to this issue",
