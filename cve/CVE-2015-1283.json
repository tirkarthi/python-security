            "description": "The version of Tenable Passive Vulnerability Scanner (PVS) installed on the remote host is 5.x < 5.2.0. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :\n\n  - Multiple denial of service vulnerabilities exist in     Expat within file xmlparse.c due to a logical error in     hash computations. An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit these, via a specially crafted XML file     containing many identifiers with the same value, to     cause the service to exhaust CPU resources.\n    (CVE-2012-0876, CVE-2016-5300)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the generate_hash_secret_salt()     function in file lib/xmlparse.c within Expat due to the     generation of non-random output by the PRNG. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     more easily predict the PRNG output. (CVE-2012-6702)\n\n  - Multiple buffer overflow conditions exist within Expat,     specifically in the XML_GetBuffer() function in file     lib/xmlparse.c, due to improper validation of     user-supplied input when handling compressed XML     content. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit     these to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-1283,     CVE-2016-4472)\n\n  - Multiple buffer overflow conditions exist within the     Expat XML parser when handling malformed input documents     due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit these to     cause a denial of service condition or the execution of     arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0718, CVE-2016-0719)\n\n  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in s3_srvr.c,     ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c due to improper use of pointer     arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit these to     cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2177)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the     dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure     to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.\n    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,     via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key     information. (CVE-2016-2178)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS     implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the     lifetime of queue entries associated with unused     out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple     crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.\n    (CVE-2016-2179)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the X.509 Public     Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)     implementation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can     exploit this, via a crafted time-stamp file that is     mishandled by the 'openssl ts' command, to cause     denial of service or to disclose sensitive information.\n    (CVE-2016-2180)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the     Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation due to     improper handling of epoch sequence numbers in records.\n    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,     via spoofed DTLS records, to cause legitimate packets to     be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)\n\n  - An overflow condition exists in the BN_bn2dec() function     in bn_print.c due to improper validation of     user-supplied input when handling BIGNUM values. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)\n\n  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the 3DES     and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit     block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker     who has sufficient resources can exploit this     vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a     collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret     and a known plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the     secret text, such as secure HTTPS cookies, and possibly     resulting in the hijacking of an authenticated session.\n    (CVE-2016-2183)\n\n  - A flaw exists in SQLite due to the use of insecure     temporary directories. A local attacker can exploit this     to cause a denial of service condition or possibly have     other more severe impact. (CVE-2016-6153)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the tls_decrypt_ticket() function in     t1_lib.c due to improper handling of ticket HMAC     digests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit     this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the     process, resulting in a denial of service.\n    (CVE-2016-6302)\n\n  - An integer overflow condition exists in the     MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper     validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,     remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based     buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service     condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.\n    (CVE-2016-6303)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()     function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly     large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via     large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory     resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n    (CVE-2016-6304)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the SSL_peek() function in     rec_layer_s3.c due to improper handling of empty     records. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit     this, by triggering a zero-length record in an SSL_peek     call, to cause an infinite loop, resulting in a denial     of service condition. (CVE-2016-6305)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the certificate     parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker     to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate     operations. (CVE-2016-6306)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the     state-machine implementation due to a failure to check     for an excessive length before allocating memory. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a     crafted TLS message, to exhaust memory resources.\n    (CVE-2016-6307)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS     implementation due to improper handling of excessively     long DTLS messages. An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit this, via a crafted DTLS message, to exhaust     available memory resources. (CVE-2016-6308)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the     read_state_machine() function in statem.c due to     improper handling of messages larger than 16k. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a     specially crafted message, to cause a use-after-free     error, resulting in a denial of service condition or     possibly the execution of arbitrary code.\n    (CVE-2016-6309)\n\n  - A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists within     the JQuery UI dialog() function due to improper     validation of input to the 'closeText' parameter before     returning it to users. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, via a specially crafted     request, to execute arbitrary script code in a user's     browser session. (CVE-2016-7103)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in x509_vfy.c     due to improper handling of certificate revocation lists     (CRLs). An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit     this, via a specially crafted CRL, to cause a NULL     pointer dereference, resulting in a crash of the     service. (CVE-2016-7052)\n\n  - An unspecified cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability     exists in the web interface due to improper validation     of input before returning it to users. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a     specially crafted request, to execute arbitrary script     code in a user's browser session.",
